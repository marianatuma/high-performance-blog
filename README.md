## Description

This project is a very simple, barebones frontend for a blog, built simply to understand and familiarize myself with Azion, a new platform for edge-computing.

The backend is mocked by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Tech Stack

- **Azion**: Brazilian platform that provides CDN, edge computing and security services for high-performance and scalability. You can learn more about Azion [here](https://www.azion.com/en/)
  - Azion automatically creates Github actions that handle CI/CD, and an Angular boilerplate project.
- **Angular**: _The_ frontend framework. This blog is built with Angular 18.
- **Typescript**: Typescript is a Javascript superset - more robust, intuitive and powerful.

# Angular Boilerplate

With the **Angular Boilerplate**, you can simplify and enhance the deployment of Angular applications directly on the edge of the network. This template provides an automation solution that encapsulates several steps, from repository management to edge deployment, accelerating and simplifying your workflow.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Angular Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/angular-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Angular CLI version `18.2.11`.
